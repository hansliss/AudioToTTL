# AudioToTTL
Audio to TTL adapter stage from my MIDI converter.

This was taken from a schematic for an analogue frequency counter, design 27 in the Elektor book "501 elektroniska byggprojekt" (ISBN 91-86898-00-0) from 1995, a translation from a Dutch book from 1984.

I used this with great success in a 1999 project to convert square wave audio to MIDI using an Atmel AT90S1200, and it turned out to be able to extract information from mixed audio as well. It can probably be used with an Arduino to build frequency counters and similar projects.
